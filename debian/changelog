  * Add variable mirrorbase to popanal.py, to make it easier to set up
    a new server.
  * Remove listing email as the transport method in the package
    description, and make the description independent of the method
    used.  This reflect the new HTTP transport support. (Closes: #321056)
  * Update the FAQ to better reflect the support for HTTP submissions.
  * popcon-upload-ubuntu: Replace ubuntulinux.org with ubuntu.com.  Patch
    from Colin Watson and Ubuntu.
  * Correct use of 'su' in cron-script.  (Closes: #331438)
  * Make it possible to get popcon to only report using HTTP.  Patch
    from Vagrant Cascadian. (Closes: #325030)
  * Added debian/compat to set debhelper compatibility level to 4, and
    remove debian/conffiles as it is no longer needed.
  * Let popcon-submit.cgi pipe incoming reports through prepop.pl
    instead of saving it directly to disk, to make sure the same
    sanity checks are done for both HTTP and SMTP reports.  Thanks to
    Bill Allombert for pointing out the risks of the old approach.

  * Add scripts to clean out non-debian packages from the entries, to
    make it possible to publish anonymous raw data.  Based on code
    from Alain Schroeder.
  * Rewrote popcon-upload to submit reports using MIME-encoded file
    uploads to match the common practice for browser-based file
    uploads. (Closes: #319019)
  * Change popcon-submit.cgi to handle uploads in both the old upload
    format and the new upload format, as well as the ubuntu
    (uncompressed) format.
  * Add support in popcon-submit.cgi to save directly to disk instead
    of sending emails.
  * Change popcon-submit-ubuntu.cgi to make it easier to run with
    older python versions, and make sure the reply matches the
    "success" string used by popcon-upload.
  * Change popcon.pl to read section info from the stable branch as
    well, and make sure it keep working even if one of the sections
    are empty.
  * Use more variables in popcon-process.sh to make it easier to
    deploy on other servers.
  * Change code for detecting old dpkg version and using dpkg-awk
    instead to avoid error message when dpkg-query is missing. Modify
    dependency to depend on 'dpkg (>= 1.10) | dpkg-awk'.  This should
    make sure it work on woody as well.
  * Make sure the server scripts are installed uncompressed, for easy
    access when setting up a server.

  * Add support for reporting using http POST to a list of URLs.
    Uploading using content-type text/plain, content-encoding
    x-gzip, with 30 second timeout. (Closes: #239097)
  * HTTP submissions are enabled by default for new installs, but
    disabled by default for upgrades.
  * New client script /usr/share/popularity-contest/popcon-upload.
  * New server CGI /usr/share/doc/popularity-contest/popcon.cgi.
  * Added simple FAQ entry about the http POST feature.
  * Code done by Bill Allombert.  Patch based on code from Ubuntu,
    though reimplemented in perl to avoid python dependency.  The
    ubuntu versions are included in the source package as
    popcon-submit-ubuntu.cgi and popcon-upload-ubuntu.
  * Added low priority debconf question asking if http should be used.
    Only ask this question if participating.
  * Rewrote the participation template text, to only talk about
    submissions and not emails, making it neutral to the submission
    method used.
  * debian/cron.weekly:
    - Try to run /usr/share/popularity-contest/popcon-upload if
      USEHTTP is enabled
    - Do not send email if http POST method was successfull.
    - Do not run sendmail if it is not available, to work without
      mail-transport-agent.  Redused depend on mail-transport-agent to
      recommends, as the default for new installs is HTTP, and
      existing installations are expected to already have
      mail-transport-agent installed.
  * Depend on ${misc:Depends} instead of debconf, to get the updated
    debconf dependency.
  * Rewrote popularity-contest to use dpkg-awk if dpkg-query is
    missing.  This make it compatible with dpkg versions before 1.10,
    getting it to work on woody, sarge, etch and sid.  Drop versioned
    dependency on dpkg because of this.
  * Implemented sending of compressed MIME emails when recommended
    package mime-construct is installed.  Disabled until the server
    side is implemented. (Debian bug #149425)

popularity-contest (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Add Dutch debconf template translation (nl.po).  File from
      Bart Cornelis. (Closes: #217038)
    - Add URLs to the project home page in manual page and README file.
    - Make it possible to reconfigure this package by calling
      'dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest', to get the code in
      base-config working as it should. (Closes: #228535).
      This should still fix bug #135273, as the current PARTICIPATE
      value is taken from the current config file, and only that
      variable is modified if the user using debconf change the value.
    - Collect and report the content of /etc/debian_version.
    - Start using generic address survey@popcon.debian.org. (Closes: #206830)
    - Ask if the submit address should be changed on upgrades and
      reconfigures.  This should activate the new address on old
      installations.
    - Updated all translation files with the new question text.
    - Started on Norwegian Bokmål debconf translation (no.po).
  * Bill Allombert
    - control: change exim to exim4. (Closes: #228575)
    - Update documentation to refer to popcon.debian.org.

popularity-contest (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Provide 'popcon', to make it easier to find this package by
      its common short name. (Closes: #215563)
    - Add new program popcon-largest-unused.  Script from Yann Dirson,
      manual page from Petter Reinholdtsen. (Closes: #127633)
  * Bill Allombert
    - Rewrite popularity-contest in perl.
      No user-visible changes outside speed.
    - Don't use dpkg-architecture anymore. (Closes: #212736)
    - control: use dpkg-query so depends on dpkg (>= 1.10)
    - control: remove gawk and dpkg-awk from dependencies.
    - update copyright notice.

popularity-contest (1.3-1.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * NMU.
  * Do not ship /etc/popularity-contest.conf; don't change it using
    debconf if it already exists; don't mark it as a conffile (since we
    don't ship it any more).  (Closes: #135273)
    This should be sufficient to get popularity-contest back into woody.
  * #136510 appears to have been fixed in 1.2 or 1.3-1.  (Closes: #136510)
    (If you want to participate question is now boolean.)

popularity-contest (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow overriding the From: and Sender: headers in outgoing mail by
    adding a new MAIL_FROM variable in /etc/popularity-contest.conf.  Also
    drop to user "nobody" before running.  Closes: #89530, #39501, #69823, 
    #74809, #57257, #57709, #65218.  Okay, this was obviously a popular
    request, but if people would just configure their mailers not to use
    invalid From: lines by default, they would be a lot happier.
    
  * Added a popularity-contest.8 manpage.  Closes: #39501.
  
  * Updated README.  Closes: #105668.

popularity-contest (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now runs only once a week instead of once a day.  Fixes bug#53768.
  
  * Let sendmail auto-generate the From header.  Fixes bug#48195, bug#48200.
  
  * Warnings about Received and Message-Id e-mail lines that may reveal the
    sender.  Fixes bug#31205.
    
  * Actually even version 0.1-2 saved the popcon results to a log file, so
    that fixes bug#44801.
    
  * Uses a more unique ID string than just the hostname, and it persists
    across hostname changes.
